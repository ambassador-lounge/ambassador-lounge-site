In July I was lucky enough to be asked back to give a workshop at the [Melbourne AWS Programming and Tools Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-AWS-Programming-and-Tools-Meetup/). This meetup is always a lot of fun as it's all about going hands on. This workshop is now available on [GitHub and you can work through it at your own pace](https://github.com/ArjenSchwarz/workshop-cfn-macros).
