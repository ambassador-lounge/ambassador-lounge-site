bio:
  - Guy sees technology, mostly, as a force for good.  As a long-term fan of OSS and the philosophies that underpin it, Guy was drawn to the AWS Cloud in 2009 and has been using and learning more about it ever since. It is a journey that never ends.  Guy is interested to see how the Cloud (and the Internet of Things) continues to shape our lives over the coming decades.
